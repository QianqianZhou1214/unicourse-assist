# UniCourse AI - RAG Question Answering

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for university course information. Users can input questions through a web interface and receive answers generated by an LLM (OpenAI GPT) using contextual data stored in a vector database (ChromaDB). The project uses **MCP (Multi-Component Pipeline)** architecture to modularize the system components.

---

## Features

- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines a vector database search with an LLM for accurate answers.
- **Vector Database**: Uses ChromaDB to store embeddings of course documents.
- **Embeddings**: Generated using HuggingFace's `sentence-transformers`.
- **MCP (Multi-Component Pipeline)**: Modular architecture to separate components (search, LLM, API) for better scalability.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Exposes API endpoints for question answering.
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML + JavaScript interface to ask questions and see answers.
